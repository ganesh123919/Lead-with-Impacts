Global Biosensor Detection Market Insights
Biosensor Detection Market size was valued at USD 22.0 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 34.0 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.0% from 2024 to 2030.

Biosensor Detection Market Overview
The global biosensor detection market was valued at USD 25.15 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 27.40 billion in 2024 to USD 55.78 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 9.3% during the forecast period. North America dominated the biosensors market with a market share of 44.77% in 2023. Biosensors are analytical instruments that convert biological reactions from cells, tissues, organisms, and enzymes into electrical signals to detect target chemicals or analytes. A typical biosensor consists of a bioreceptor that recognizes explicitly the analyte and a transducer that converts the bio-recognition event into a measurable signal. These small instruments are used in multidisciplinary applications such as medical applications, agriculture, environmental monitoring, food control, and biomedical research. The incidence of chronic disorders such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases is growing across the globe. The surge in prevalence has increased the demand for medical devices in the diagnosis of the underlying disease among the population across hospitals and clinical settings. Additionally, an increase in the presence of diagnostic devices equipped with biosensors aids in rapid, accurate, and pain-free diagnosis of diseases among patients, which boosts the growth of the market. Moreover, the rise in collaborations among semiconductor and medical device companies to develop such devices with sensor platforms to achieve high-precision detection across several applications further propels the growth of the global market. For instance, in September 2020, Abbott introduced the Libre Sense glucose sport biosensor for athletes to continuously measure glucose levels, enhancing their understanding of the correlation between glucose levels and athletic performance. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred market growth in 2020, prompting a shift from laboratory-based diagnostics to point-of-care diagnostics across health settings and home care, accelerating the adoption of these products among industry players. The rise in at-home/self-testing during the post-pandemic time and the high demand for biosensors-enabled products in home settings further augmented the market growth in 2021.
